                Nobody knows how this flower came to be. It was first seen deep in the Theta Forests. A jungle so dense, light could barely penetrate its canopy.
                It was discovered by explorers sent from the Ryola plains. Botanists from that land started their expedition to enrich their knowledge of the flora in the contitent.
                <br><br>They brought the specimen back, thinking that they were the only ones to ever lay eyes on it. Months passed in studying it. But in those months the flower started blooming closer to the plains.
                In such little time, so many of those flowers sprouted that they covered the plains. It started appearing even inside the city of Ryola. Then people started dying.
                <br><br>It felt like a takeover. So slow was the progression that no-one paid any mind to it. To the common folk it was just a beautiful flower.
                But the pollen released from it was toxic. And it built up in the Ryolan air so silently. Not before long the air had more pollen than oxygen. <br><br>
                I won't go into the details of the gruesome deaths that followed. Any macabre historian will gladly share such information. All I will say is this.
                From the moment the botanists brought it back, to the moment the last person died, one lonely year had passed. Exactly one. <br><br>

                Neighboring states found out about it. Their course of action was fire but no matter how many acres they incinerated, the flower kept blooming above the ashes.
                What was rather curious is that the flower was not trying to invade the neighbor states. As if it was content with the Ryolan plains.
                Then again, it seemed rather content with the Theta Forests. Till one ambitious team of explorers decided to study it, disturb it.

                <br><br>
                Many years after the events of the Ryolan plains, the flower was given a name. The Spider. And never again was it disturbed.
