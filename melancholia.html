                        "A flower that resembles a promise. For all those tortured by demons larger than their shadows. For those lost in endless nightmares,
                        forced to see their reflections in broken mirrors, distorted and malformed. A dandelion holding inside it the hope for a sorrowless morrow.
                        A day where all those aches and hardships will no longer apply. A day when thoughts and anathemas will no more anchor the troubled to
                        abyssal depths"
                    </i>.
                    <br><br>
                    This phrase is chipped in a wooden sign, near a field full of dandelions. It is believed that this flower can soothe those with troubles
                    throughout the universe. You pluck it and make a wish. Then the flower holds in its countless buds your worries your fears your anxieties,
                    all the darkness that clutches around your neck. Then you blow and as the buds are scattered in the wind, so are your problems.
                    <br><br>
                    This belief stems from a fable about a woman that lost her husband in a nameless war. The poor soul spent her life lamenting the loss of 
                    her spouse. Soon after she fell to what doctors called, Melancholia. A state in which the mind forces the body to stop functioning as it should.
                    The troubles lady had no will left to even do the minimum a person should. She abandoned herself and was left in an oblivious state, for years.
                    <br><br>
                    After a while and for reasons no one really knows, a boy left a basket with fruits at her front door. In that basket was a lonesome dandelion.
                    The woman found the basket and took it in, took the fruit to her bowl and after that was left staring at the dandelion.
                    <br><br>
                    Some days later she took the flower, closed her eyes and imagined everything that weighed her down, all her despair and sorrow. With her
                    eyes still closed, she wished that she'd find beauty and awe again in the world. That her soul would return to her body. Then, with a loud 
                    wooshing sound she blew on the dandelion. The buds flew in all directions and after a while hit the floor. All that was left was the stem of
                    the dandelion. She stared at it for a few minutes then left it on the kitchen counter.
                    <br><br>
                    It didn't happen immediately, but a few days later she found the energy to clean her house. To have a nice hot bath as she used to.
                    She even went outside for a walk. She loved those. In one of her walks she came across the dandelion field. So large it was, it stretched
                    to the horizon. Countless little dandelions moving slightly with the sweet summer breeze.
                    <br><br>
                    A day later she returned with a wooden sign and chipped the phrase on it.
