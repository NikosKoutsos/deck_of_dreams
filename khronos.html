                <p>
                    According to Hamal al-Rashid,author of the Celestial Mythos, creation began when this God drew his first breath. Hidden within every
                    speck of sand, under any molecule of soil, water and air. Burrowed inside every organism's body, Time ticks his unforgiving clock.
                    And every second we lose, He gains. The Celestial Mythos states that every ten seconds or so, someone's life runs out of time.
                    <br><br>
                    By many considered a thief, stealing precious life, Khronos was the very concept of time. An ageless God stealing seconds from mortals.
                    A job He did with much pleasure. Most cultures fear this deity more than any other. A relentless ruler that made no exceptions for anyone.
                    Many Kings tried to bribe his influence with riches, land and anything else a mortal can think of. But those gifts meant nothing. What meaning
                    do riches have to a God, let alone a God that deals in seconds, hours, days, years. " <i>One soul ran out time</i> "
                    <br><br>
                    His symbol was the white lily. When a mortal is born, a white lily appears somewhere in the cosmos. As the mortal lives his life, unbeknownst to them
                    the flower loses petals. When the mortal's man is over, the lily will have lost its last petal. This story alone is enough to put fear into one's heart.
                    " <i>Another soul ran out of Time</i> ".
                    <br><br>
                    Ruthless though as he may have appeared, Khronos found love in the face—or lack thereof—of a nameless Goddess. During one of his many journeys across the 
                    unknown universe, he saw in the deep space, the reflection of another world. A folded universe inside his own. When he turned around he saw one of her
                    fabrics extending infinitely. Though she had no face, he fell in love with her in an instant. " <i>Another one</i> ".
                    <br><br>
                    They were together for a while—not sure if that metric of time is relevant—but sadly had to part ways. Both him and the faceless Goddess
                    were deep in sorrow. They had found each other but the fates would have them part ways. He decided to give her a parting gift. With his hand,
                    he reached deep inside his incorporeal body and gave her a flower. A white lily. Should She miss Him, she needed only look at the flower and
                    He'd be there, cradling Her in His arms. They both cried and parted ways. " <i>Yet another one</i> ".
                    <br><br>
                    Little did the omnipotent God know, the flower would become a detriment to the Goddess' existence. With this thorny gift, He had doomed Her
                    existence, forcing Her to lose Her godly immortality. Eons would pass and the first petal would fall. What was worse is that He could feel it.
                    Countless years later, mere seconds for Khronos, the faceless deity would sadly die.
                    <br><br>
                    Buried in sorrow and shame, Khronos hid away in the edge of creation, never to be seen again by any creature alive or otherwise. He had killed
                    the love of His life and the whole of Cosmos would pay the price.
                    <br><br>
                    " <i>Alas, another one</i> ".
