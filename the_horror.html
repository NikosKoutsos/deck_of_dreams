                Wherever it travelled, alien things took place. Nothing human could describe this physique. Nothing alive could relate to it. No one dared
                ask its name, if it had any. During the millenia it wonders aimlessly, it has garnered many titles. "The Invader", "The Sightless", "The Usurper"..
                As the years passed it came to be known with one name that everyone agreed would fit this creature perfectly. "The Horror".  <br><br>
                A faceless fiend, with abhorrent tendrils extending from its back. Shapeless but always well dress and a burning head. Should one look at it
                even for a second, one was doomed. You see, its image was branded in the mind of any unfortunate or curious enough to lay their eyes upon it.
                Of course, one would not die just by looking at it. But, I suppose, one must eventually go to sleep. <br><br>
                Such was its modus operandi. Once people were fast asleep it invaded, poisoning their dreams with images of indescribable dread. This torture
                kept going, till the individuals yielded. The fiend practically waited till its victim begged to die, that's when it finally killed.
                Of course, no one has survived its attack to share the fever dreams that were enforced upon them. Maybe that's for the better.
                <br><br>
                All the victims shared the same expression. An agonizing gaze with mouths open, as if they were trying to scream. I will not go into details
                about the gruesome state of the rest of the bodies. Just know that in some rare cases, the sight alone was enough to make some take their own lives.
                <br><br>

                <i>"I felt it. I was on my way home from work. The air suddenly changed direction, as it was running away from that Horror. Everything around went cold.
                    Out of fear I averted my gaze to the road. I was petrified. Some seconds later, there he was. Standing in front of me. I was shaking. It kept whispering.
                    It tried to persuade me to look at him. Thank god I had my scissors in the pocket of my coat. I had to do it as fast as possible, otherwise I'd be dead.
                    I may never see the beautiful moon again. I may never gaze at the stars in the night sky. But I get to live. I live.."</i>
