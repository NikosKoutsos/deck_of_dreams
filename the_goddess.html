                    Almost every culture in the system of Estril believed in this deity. Yet, no man mortal or otherwise could name her. No one alive knew
                    what Her name was. Strange as that was, her worship was even stranger. Every country in every planet in all of Estril had a temple in her "name".
                    Here comes the strange part. In every temple her shape was different. The color of her hair, her eyes, her height, everything. No two temples
                    had the same statue. <br><br>
                    
                    Perhaps that is precisely the reason She looked as She did. Wearing a white tattered drape. Her body was covered in tapestries. According to legends
                    lost in distant dreams, every tapestry contained a different universe. In every piece of fabric extending from her body, lives were being lived.
                    People died, more were born. Inside those every outcome of life was being played out. Who knows how many times. <br><br>

                    And Her face. Without anything of note. Not even eyes. In it, you could see reflections of different realities. Universes long lost in dimensions
                    as far as the Imagination could strech, or as close as human touch.

                    <br><br>
                    No one ever dared to look straight at her faceless guile. Think about it, what would you see if you did? how would you know if She  were happy?
                    Sad? Flustered? The mortal kind bases a lot of their psyche in facial expressions. How could you commune with such a being? If not with a smile
                    or a frown?. So when she'd pay a visit to one of her many shrines no soul alive would dare to look straight at Her. Thus, every temple of her was
                    always different from the last. <br><br>

                    The only thing that was the same in every temple was the offering. A single white lily. That flower reminded Her of her long lost love.
                    They loved each other deeply but so cruel was their fate that they were ultimately separated. That lily was his gift to her. Told her
                    she could always have a part of him with her. <br><br>

                    <i>"That flower had a different name. An apocryphic name not many knew. The flower's name was Khronos.Time Himself"</i>
