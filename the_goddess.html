                To the citizen of the Grenara Empire, it was a day like any other. People going about their daily lives, children playing in the streets.
                Nothing out of the ordinary. Nothing to suggest what was about to come. It happened in an fraction of a second, yet it took hours. At least
                that was how the Star-Gazers described it. Their order was tasked with watching the skies. They were the first to observe the anomaly.
                The sun of their system, had just disappered. Vanished without leaving a trace behind. Close as their planet was, it only took five minutes
                for everyone to realise. <br><br>

                Five minutes that passed like a second and like a century alike. What the Gazers saw next was a miracle. Or a calamity. 
                That depends on the Eye of the Beholder I suppose. The Black Hole would form when the five minutes would be over. Nobody really knows how such a feat was possible. Or why it happened.
                A singularity was formed right in front of everyone's eyes. It wasn't shrinking, It wasn't growing. It, just was.
                A few days would pass in chaos as the people of the Grenara Empire thought everything was over. The street Pariahs and Doomsayers all chanted. <br>
                <i> "The End is upon us"</i>
                <br><br>
                Alas, that was very far from the truth. As it turned out, their planet would continue to orbit around it in a steady pace. The light that was sucked inside the Black Hole
                kept the little planet away from darkness. The massive torrents of energy released from it would keep their planet warm.
                No one ever found out why such an event took place. Where this Singularity had come from. Or why.
                What was certain was that the planet would never again be greeted by the night sky. Their beautiful moons were gone. Their neighboring stars, too.
                All they could see when they dared to look up was a gaping pit. The abyss itself. <br><br>

                <i>"Sometimes I think I can hear it. It speaks, but how? Why?".<br> "Sometimes.. Oh God, sometimes I think I can see my reflection in it".</i>
