                    " <i>Nothing is worse, than having to live in solitude. Even these flowers know this</i> ". This was the final sentence of the lead Ryolan
                    Botanist. In his report, he documented this peculiar rose. A flower that bloomed alone, yet throughout the course of its life, would search
                    for another flower to pair with. Then the two flowers would entangle themselves forever. The botanists in Ryola named these peculiar flowers,
                    The Lovers.
                    <br><br>
                    They were native to the plains of Ryola but sadly went extinct when The Spider took over. It sapped the nutrients from the plains and left
                    every other flora to perish. What was once a marvelous sight full of this pink roses, now seemed like a red graveyard. The Lovers were never 
                    again spotted in the Ryolan Plains. These reports were cicrulated around many Universities specializing in botany. Then, some years later the 
                    most curious thing happened.
                    <br><br>
                    A single pink rose appeared outside a forager's house. A continent away from its home. The forager not knowing what it was, didn't bother the 
                    flower at all. After all, if he didn't know it he woudn't profit from harvesting it. Instead, he watered it daily.
                    Days turned to months and months to years. Then, a summer morning, a woman came upon the forager's house. She wanted to buy from his produce.
                    Around her belt, she had plucked in a flower. A pink rose.
                    <br><br>
                    After dealing with one another, the forager couldn't help but ask her where she found it. She said it blossomed outside her house, it had come
                    out of a stone. The forager quickly showed her the flower that had grown right outside her door. None of them knew anything about the flowers.
                    Yet they both felt an inexplicable sadness for the one rooted in the ground. The woman decided to leave her flower next to it and left.
                    <br><br>
                    The forager had no clue about the sight he'd wake up to. Come next morning, the rose had rooted itself next to the other. It entangled it in such
                    a fashion, that it resembled a loving hug. The second rose was not rooted itself, but the hug provided nutrients to it, keeping it alive. The man ran
                    to the city and found the woman that came by his house the day before. He brought her back to see the flowers hugging. They both cried.
                    <br><br>
                    Some months later the two of them would marry.
                    <br><br>
                    Was it chance? Or perhaps these flowers not only search for love, but share it with anyone willing to accept it? For the newly wed couple, it was the latter.
                    Or at least that is what they chose to believe. Years later, they learned about the origin of the Lovers. It felt like finding out something already
                    discovered. It did not feel new to them. As if they already knew. Years later, what were two Lovers, would be come a whole field.
