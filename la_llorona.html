                    This woman was once a radiant beauty. Her smile would warm even the coldest hearts. Her kindness, unrivaled. Hard to believe right?
                    It all happened a summer day. Her children had taken her ears off for a trip to the river. She loved them so much, how could she refuse?
                    So, they all went to the river for a picnic. They found their spot close to the river around elderberry bushes. Finally, she thought, 
                    a carefree day that her family can enjoy the beautiful riverside.
                    <br><br>
                    She had already set her ground rules, and the most important was that the kids play close to their spot so she can always see them.
                    And they did. But the woman was exhausted and inevitably, she fell asleep.
                    <br><br>
                    Couple hours later she woke up and was doused in dread immediately. Three children and no sound. Not one laughing screaming playing.
                    Nothing. In the time she was deep in slumber, a huge stream passed through the river. In one moment the roaring river had swept her
                    children. Panicked as she was, she started screaming their names, screaming for help, screaming to any God eager to listen, but no
                    God dared to reach and tell her what had happened.
                    <br><br>
                    She searched across the river and found some of their clothes. As it was bound to happen a few minutes later she found their bodies.
                    All of them dead. In an fraction of a second, she went mad. She screamed so much she damaged her voicebox so irrevocably that her voice
                    dissapeared.
                    <br><br>
                    In her delirium she grabbed a fruit knife she packed for the picnic and started stabbing her body. When the villagers found her, they
                    counted fifty stabbings. But her flesh was so ravaged that the true number of stabs could be a lot more than that.
                    <br><br>
                    After that incident, countless villagers have reported of seeing a tall female silhouette with a racket on her hair full of vibrant 
                    flowers. She crosses the river all night, screaming, crying, searching.
                    <br><br>
                    A few children abductions have been reported as well.
