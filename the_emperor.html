                    No one really knows what his name is. The dune dwellers know him as Hastur. The scholars of the Nera foundation named him The King in Yellow.
                    I have heard both of these names for years, but deep in the Archive—the largest library in the known universe—before the two names, sits a title. <i>The Emperor</i>
                    <br><br>
                    What little information they shared was that almost all the books about him were lost in a fire some decades back.
                    Of course that was a lie. But for the bastions of knowledge, to shun information so blatanly was rather curious. The information I am about to relay
                    to you comes from the burnt books. Let's say I borrowed them.
                    <br><br>
                    Although there is no land to his name, planet or system, there is a name. Carcossa. His home. He has walked traversed reality since before the birth of Khronos, the embodiment of Time. His own body is comprised of a universe separate from our creation, he wears
                    a Yellow Tattered Mantle on his body, a Yellow Crown on his head and above him lies his Yellow Sign.
                    <br><br>
                    Wherever he walked, silence would follow. Not out of awe. Any and all sounds would cease to exist before his presence. Sound would have no purpose, for 
                    what sort of sound would help one, should one have the misfortune of standing in front of Hastur? The face hiding behind the Yellow Crown was said to be 
                    a reflection of the Universe. Behind this mirror a new reality exactly opposite of ours existed. When his mantle moved, trendril-like extensions would appear.
                    Apparently there is no record of anyone every touching the tendrils, perhaps for the better.
                    <br><br>
                    What is rather interesting, is this Yellow Sign. There are claims from all over the world, of people witnessing this sign. Some from books that would be 
                    signed with it, others would recognize the pattern in clouds or in paintings and some dreamt it. No matter the media, it had the same result for those that
                    saw it. They all had the same destination. The Voranta Asylum for the insane. They all chanted in a language that does not exist. At least not yet, or not
                    anymore. Before dying, every single one of the infected mortals whispered the same thing. <i>Carcossa</i>.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps my syllogism is faulty. Perhaps, his Empire does not exist in the corporeal world. After all in all the charts of the Universe, no such place
                    as Carcossa exists. But, if everything in this creation is created with a reason to be, what is his? What does the King in Yellow want? Why does he wander
                    in the cosmos, seemingly without aim. Did all those poor souls really reunite in this Carcossa?
                    <br><br>
                    That is all the information I could gather. Along with this excerpt written in this apocryphic language. Better return these.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Zhorrvek ilqath nysvor, dralith vokssun Carcossa naxivir; Nalthrek visqorin zyrvakthol, draquneth ilmorvek thazrul vixnorath; Vorskell thrynzeth akralith, mazquor zelnith vyrkothral
                    Vhranok minthraal quorsvek, lysvrenn akthoril draxquiv nalvethron viskaal Thryvek nosvran ulthorqeth, velkthar draxnil vorquith zelvorrun.
                    </i>.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>This is the thing that troubles me, for I cannot forget Carcosa where black stars hang in the heavens; where the shadows of men's thoughts lengthen in the afternoon, when the twin suns sink into the lake of Hali; and my mind will bear for ever the memory of the Pallid Mask. I pray God will curse the writer, as the writer has cursed the world with its beautiful stupendous creation, terrible in its simplicity, irresistible in its truth--a world which now trembles before the King In Yellow.</i>
