                    A force of nature. Her greatest creation. However intimidating he seemed, his heart was pure. A Guardian for all the lost and broken.
                    He traversed the cosmos like a sailor. Never staying more that what was needed, always helping those in need. In his trail peace followed.
                    His left hand resembled tree roots and in the other he grapsed his staff. A branch from Yggdrasil. He adorned his incorporeal form with a mantle
                    he fashioned from a living jungle. And inside that mantle countless universes would hide away from the rest of reality. <br><br>
                    According to reports from the Trevano University, the Guardian used his body as a shelter for refugees across the Cosmos. He was sighted at the last
                    Silent War, in the constellation of Mara. He Opened his mantle and let all the civilians inside one of his many worlds. Few months later, a nameless
                    planet would have its first habitants.
                    <br><br>
                    He's been credited with rellocating many refugees to new planets and systems, far from the grasp of war or persecussion. He is also responsible for 
                    ending many wars prematurely, with his presence alone. Often times going against the wishes of the <i>Sentinels</i>.
                    He had a lot of enemies within the order, mainly because of how he conducted himself. No care for rules or regulations. His actions were almost always
                    unauthorized. You see, effective as the Sentinels was, their bureaucratic methods were a detriment. <br><br>
                    Not long after his actions in the Silent War, the order took council to address his actions. During a heated exchange, Damus the leader of the Sentinels
                    dared to address the Guardian with his true name. Damus knew very well of the complications of his action, but later said he had no alternative.
                    <br><br>
                    Thankfully, The Guardian had a friend in the order, a troublemaker like himself. A weaver of Dreams, thought to be the most powerfull of all the
                    Celestial Creatures. In the order he was known as, The Tempest. <br><br>
                    <i>"It matters not to me that you would attack me in such an unsightly fashion. What matters, my friend is our actions. That is what we are judged upon.
                        Actions. And the lack thereof. I'd much rather be your pariah, than stay my hand when children cry. Remember this day Damus, as will I."</i>
