                A force of nature. Her greatest creation. However intimidating he seemed, his heart was pure. A Guardian for all the lost and broken.
                He traversed the cosmos like a sailor. Never staying more that what was needed, always helping those in need. In his trail peace followed.
                His left hand resembled tree roots and in the other he grapsed his staff. A branch from Yggdrasil. He adorned his incorporeal form with a mantle
                he fashioned from a living jungle. And inside that mantle countless universes would hide away from the rest of reality. <br><br>
                According to reports from the Trevano University, the Guardian used his body as a shelter for refugees across the Cosmos. He was sighted at the last
                Silent War, in the constellation of Mara. He Opened his mantle and let all the civilians inside one of his many worlds. Few months later, a nameless
                planet would have its first habitants.
                <br><br>
                He's been credited with rellocating many refugees to new planets and systems, far from the grasp of war or persecussion. He is also responsible for 
                ending many wars prematurely, with his presence alone.
