                    This peculiar locket was found among the belongings of the unfortunate fisherman. He took his boat during an angry storm and went about his
                    work. The sea was roaring, waves reaching a meter height and the weight with which they hit the fisherman's weary boat felt like elephants
                    stampeding.
                    <br><br>
                    After the storm had passed the poor fisherman was spotted along the shore, his boat was torn apart as if vicious beasts sank their sharp jaws
                    in the wooden boards. The poor man was dead. The village folk quickly gathered his belongings for the funeral. The village you see, was accustomed
                    to people dying. Close to him, this curious little trinket was found. Like a locket or a keychain of sorts. A rusted golden ring penetrating the 
                    head of what appeared to be a cephalopod. On closer inspection it seemed like a squid.
                    <br><br>
                    The village's cleric took the weird artifact to bury the man with. After all, to be found with it, the man must have held it dear. The burial was
                    over shortly. The villagers went about their normal day as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Come next day, the fisherman's tomb is
                    open. Thankfully the body was not missing from the coffin which was open aswell. The only thing missing was the artifact.
                    <br><br>
                    Maybe graverobbers thought it was worth something to pawn off. Few hours later, a child would find the weird locket on the ground close to her home.
                    Not knowing its short history, the girl brought it home and kept it close to her bed.
                    <br><br>
                    What followed is not for the faint of heart. The girl's sleep became troubled, filled with all sorts of images, nightmares really. But they felt so real.
                    As if something alive had burrowed inside her little brain. She'd wake up in the middle of the night to whispers echoing in her room. Though she tried to
                    find what was making that sound she never managed to do so.
                    <br><br>
                    Once, she entered her room and no matter the angle, she could swear the little locket was looking straight at her. Staring, observing. Of course when going 
                    close to inspect the trinket it was inanimate but something about its eyes. Were they moving? Where the tiny tentacles moving? She attributed this delirium
                    to her lack of sleep.
                    <br><br>
                    Sadly, a week later the girl would be found dead on her bed. She never woke up from her sleep. When her parents tried to move her, the artifact moved form
                    under her pillow and fell to the ground. Choked with dread, her father quickly took it, went to the shore and threw it with as much strength as he could
                    gather to the ocean.
                    <br><br>
                    " <i>Who's there? Who's talking? What do you want? Please, just let me sleep. I haven't had a good night's sleep for so long. What?
                        Should I do what you ask, will you please let me rest? God, I just want to rest.
                    </i> "
