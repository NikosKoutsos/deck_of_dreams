                Reports about this shadowy figure used to come from all sorts of places. Almost everywhere in the known universe. A spawn of darkness
                posing the Priest. When word reached the holy lands of Garona, the Saints there began to investigate. Or at least, that is what they would say.
                But how do you investigate a menace that originated from your system? The official statement of the Saints was that the creature was an abomination.
                A figment of nightmares, mocking the Faith of Light by posing as a priest from their Churches.
                <br><br>
                After all, do you know of any faith that admits their mistakes? Because I've lived a long life and I have seen none. The "figment of nightmares" used 
                to belong to the ranks of the Saints. It even had a name, Saint Dreno. Amongst the many Saints I met from Garona, Dreno was the kindest. A pure heart that
                knew not to lie or deceive, unlike others. Of course, when we met he was not as he is portrayed now. His image resembled a radiant sun. Alas.
                <br><br>
                The incident that would change the trajectory of his life happened some five hundred years ago. A neighboring system was lost. At least the Astrolabs in the
                system of Garona could not see it anymore. Many expeditions were sent to investigate, none came back. The Saints were uneasy. When they convened to take 
                action, they all chanted the same course of action like a choir of cowardice. "<i>Dreno will surely handle this situation</i>". Of course, Dreno was not one
                to cower in the face of danger, but the Saints knew virtually nothing of the threat they were dealing with. When they took the matter to a vote, as was tradition,
                all were in favor. All but one.
                <br><br>
                Together with the Saints, was a young advisor. A fresh Dreamer of immense talent and power. It seemed as if he was the only one to speak reason to the bigots.
                He were good friends with Dreno, but for the other Saints, his existence was considered somewhat of a taboo. See he'd been there before and according to them,
                his life was a testimony of their failure to purge the powers of the Abyss. But I digress.
                <br><br>
                The boy held the only opposing vote in the room. He just couldn't send a good friend of his to the slaughter. That's when a rare event happened. The God-king came
                down from his holy throne. The only one that outranked the young Dream Weaver. He tipped the scales in favor of the saints and thus, Dreno was sent to the
                heart of the Darkness.
                <br><br>
                He sacrificed himself to save the lives on the small planet. He absorbed all of the abyssal darkness that had spawned. Unlike the young boy, a speck of light
                remained in Dreno's soul. A dimmed halo behind his head. His body had become an amorphous darkness. His shadow had grown larger and from it thick tar-like
                tendrils would arise.  His white robes had turned to this empty grey. Dreno would still cradle his cross. Consuming as the abyss was, it couldn't touch his faith.
                <br><br>
                For the Garona Saints though, the case was different. He was deemed a Blasphemy. A mockery in the face of the pure light. Dreno had sacrificed the better part
                of his soul for those undeserving saints. And his reward was ostracism. They even tried to kill him on the spot, but the young dreamer intervened.
                Thus, he was ostracised as well. The left the system together, though at some point the priest had just disappeared. The boy never saw him again.
