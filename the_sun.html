            <p>Since ages lost in time, this entity gave life to everything its light touched. A gentle star, casting the shadows away. The people of Earth called this bright star, the Sun.
               A different, more occult name was given to it by the ancient ones. They called it the Creator God. A star capable of creating life out of nothing. A star that could give birth to entire worlds.
               The Sun was the source of all life on Earth. It was the one that gave birth to the first living beings. It was the one that gave birth to the first humans. It was the one that gave birth to the first gods.
               To the monks of the Solaris Temples the Sun was an absolute ruler, a Maker of any and all sentient life. At least in our System. It was believed that more than one Creator Gods existed. But the Sun was among the more benevolent ones.<br><br>
    
               It is believed that once in a long while, it would take the form of humans and traverse the lands of Earth. It is said that people spot him around the Eye of the Gods, a secluded lake deep in the Echidna Forests.
               They always said the same thing. He would wait all day long, before he'd set. Close to the Sunset he'd rise up take a long look at the sky, then disappear. <br><br>During the night, long after he had left, people would approach the place he stood.
               Letters would be found there, all poems of Love. All signed in the same manner. "How beautiful, to be loved by you." <br><br><br><br>
    
               <i>How I'd love to hold you tonight. Cradle you under this beautiful starlight, like we did when we were younger. Oh my silver wife, old as I am I'm still lovestruck as I was the first time I laid my eyes on you.<br><br>
                  Till the next time, Luna. Always yours.</i>
