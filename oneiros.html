                    In the shifting veil between dusk and dawn, where the waking world surrenders to the whispers of slumber, Oneiros, the God of Dreams, stirs
                    —His form woven from starlight and dust, manifesting as an infant elephant whose eyes hold the promise of infinite worlds yet unimagined,
                    each step a ripple through the fabric of a universe only seen with eyes shut.
                    <br><br>
                    For us dreamers, Oneiros is a benevolent god, a creature of childish pureness, traversing the cosmos with the sole purpose of filling it with dreams.
                    According to our mythos, he weaves dreams by painting them on the night sky. He uses his trunk to shoot jets of ink filled with unlimited images or
                    Worlds to satisfy the minds of the mortals. To see him during his work is nothing short of a miracle. 
                    <br><br>
                    During an expedition, a dreamer whose name has been
                    redacted claimed that he witnessed the God playing, like a child, behind the moons of Pethos. The little elephant lied on his back and with his trunk created
                    a universe. The ink would drip all over the God and stars would begin to form in the puddles. Some seconds later through them whales started to jump, swimming
                    up, almost like flying into space itself. Vibrant azure whales, swimming around him in a playful manner. The whales sang their songs, and Oneiros would laugh
                    as if they were communicating with a language known only to them.
                    <br><br>
                    Childish though as he may appear, Oneiros has been a part of many wars and battles. The most notable was when he fought for the dominion of his realm.
                    An ancient nameless deity of nightmares sought to invade his dreamscape, Oneiros stood as the guardian of all slumber. 
                    In the form of the infant elephant, he ventured into the nightmare god's realm, his small form seemingly fragile. 
                    Yet with each step, he exhaled clouds of golden mist that dissolved the nightmare god's creations. 
                    Finally, he trumpeted—a sound so pure it shattered the nightmare god's dominion, banishing the intruder to the void 
                    and restoring peace to his home.
                    <br><br>
                    There is one more notable citation, of a mortal girl cursed to walk in her sleep forever. According to the reports she wandered the earth in her dream
                    and could not find her way back to the waking world. Oneiros appeared to her one night in a lucid dream, his eyes glowing like moons. The baby elephant led her to a field of flowers that hummed with the memories of other dreamers. There, he trumpeted softly, awakening her from her eternal trance. 
                    After this incident, she became a prophet, carrying messages from the god of dreams to those who had lost their way.
