                    Everyone was capable of becoming this. Whatever this abomination really was. It arrived in people's dreams uninvited. The reports from those 
                    that had the misfortune of seeing this face, were at the least chaotic. It is important to note that all these reports originate from people
                    that are now locked away in the Voranta Asylum. Of course I don't expect you to know of that specific asylum. Take my word for it, not a good
                    place to be.
                    <br><br>
                    Between the delirious rantings of the inmates and the screams, one thing was in common. The face. Everything about it. All of them said the same
                    thing, like a broken choir. Small pupils, dark circles and a grin. A very weird, distorted grin, feral and in a weird way, worn. As if it was a mask
                    or a guile. It never spoke to them, to any of them. That is precisely what drove them mad. The face was still, as if frozen or in suspended animation.
                    It felt like it wanted to talk or laugh, but it never did either. It wasn't even actively trying to mock them, which I would expect.
                    <br><br>
                    Across the people this facade haunted, there was virtually nothing in common, except one thing. Each and every one of these inmates was in some fashion,
                    broken. Be it a lost job or going homeless, losing a spouse or a family member or any other way that a human would be pushed over the edge.
                    <br><br>
                    Thus, a question is posed. Is this entity a natural phenomenon across all the broken and mad? As I said in the beginning, everyone is capable of becoming 
                    this. Such vicious misstress Life is, that she can break even the most sturdy. So is this what befalls the broken? Is this the fate that awaits all who 
                    would succumb to Life's chaos?
                    <br><br>
                    I tried my best to reason with them. But despite my best efforts to draw out their former self, no progress was made. They felt empty. Hollow husks.
                    Their being, or as the Dreamers would call it "Their reason to be", was lost. The Facade had feasted on it. <br><br>
                    <i>"We wear the mask that grins and lies,
                        It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,â€”
                        This debt we pay to human guile;
                        With torn and bleeding hearts we smile.</i>
