                To see it die, was supposed to be a once in a lifetime experience. But to see it rise again.. Oh what a sight to behold. <br><br>
                According to some scholars, the Phoenix carries the dreams of fire in its wings. For the church of Kalistram of course such theories are heretical.
                The faith cannot believe of course in legendary creatures, in fables and children's stories. <br><br>
                But what about the countless common folk, who claim to have seen it? In a dream or otherwise. Whoever saw it in a dream, it is always the same.
                They could see the bird flying off to the sunset. Full of fire and light. The further it got, the more it burned. And once it was all but gone,
                the night sky would take its place. And the cinders left behind from its burning tail would become stars. <br><br>

                Some reports exists about people dreaming of it too. A most surreal dream, almost alive. In it they would see the bird arrive on their doorstep.
                Some would see it tall as the sky. Other smaller than a sparrow. No matter the shape it had it was always gentle. Always kind. This dream would
                arrive more in children than adults. And it would be the same, more or less. <br><br>

                What is most curious is a report from a man. In his dream, that man saw the Phoenix, but instead of the aformentioned dream, he saw it die.
                He claims that he grapsed the bird gently in his hand, and weary as it was, it nested in his palm, and quietly died.
                Some seconds later, his hand would start burning but the fire didn't hurt him. Instead it felt like a warm touch. The man heard the song of the Phoenix
                and shortly after the bird was born anew. Once it took to flight, the man woke up. <br><br>

                Later, that man would be known as Nazir Al-Jahad, the Silent Prophet. He never spoke a word after that dream. He would only write.
                A thorn, against the Church of Kalistram. <br><br>
