                Everything in this cosmos is created in balance. Should much darkness accumulate, it must be dealt with light. Thus, this deity was created.
                Rather than having an actual, this creature was defined by concept. The embodiment of Benevolence. The warm hug at the end of a nightmare.
                A beacon of light in rooms that felt like a gaping pit.
                <br><br>
                Like most of the cosmic entities, It would arrive in the dreams of those inviting. It talked in a language not known to man but strangely, anyone
                who saw Benevolence in their dream would understand it as if they were fluent in whatever language it spoke. A lot of tribes kept it in their prayers.
                But among every culture, the refugees. See, Benevolence was the face of hope for them, their last plea before their doom. Together with a particular
                Sentinel, they saved many refugees and prevented or outright stopped wars. Where Benevolence went, people would immediately cease their fighting, they'd 
                lose interest. Where the Sentinel went, they had no alternative.
                <br><br>
                No one really knows the origins of this celestial. The more popular theory is that Benevolence is the Cosmos' answer to cruelty. That creation
                itself decided to take action. Many more theories sprung over the years, but should we choose to arbitrarily base our belief in any of those,
                I think I'd rather base it on the aformentioned.
                <br><br>
                There is some form of poetic beauty to it. That Benevolence is part of the fabric of reality.
                A reality that couldn't bear to witness innocent children, men and women be sacrificed in the name of wars.
