                    Nothing is known of this abomination. What grotesque force could have birthed such a malformed entity?
                     Even its image is corruption, a blight upon reality.
                    <br>
                    Darkness seeps into all things, creeping from the cracks of existence—but nothing compares to this. 
                    It is neither demon nor vengeful spirit, neither god nor any being born of mercy or warmth. 
                    It is a thing forged in the void, where all light has withered and all goodness has been stripped away. 
                    Across every civilization, every forgotten tribe, every whispering cult, none have dared to name it.
                    <br><br>
                    Those unfortunate enough to glimpse its form have sought death in any way possible, as if the mere knowledge of its existence 
                    was an infection they could only cure through oblivion. Horror, dread, despair—such words fall short of describing the primal terror
                    it invokes.
                    <br>
                    One truth is known: it cannot exist alone. It must find a host—a willing vessel to harbor its vile presence. 
                    The one who accepted this parasitic blasphemy is said to still live, unable to die, ensnared in an eternal torment 
                    from which there is no escape.
                    <br><br>
                    There is no sign, no omen to warn of its presence. It burrows beneath the flesh, unseen, waiting, manifesting only when the moment is right. 
                    No spell, no divination, no science can detect it. Some have called it nature’s Apex Predator, 
                    a thing so perfectly concealed that its existence defies all logic. But could nature truly spawn something so utterly devoid of reason? 
                    Cold-blooded hunters kill to survive—this thing kills for something far worse.
                    <br><br>
                    Those who have seen it and lived speak of an abomination—a perversion of flesh and bone. A body of sloughing, putrid tissue, 
                    its skeleton exposed in places where its own form betrays itself. Heads emerge from its torso, each frozen in a silent, endless scream. 
                    Black tendrils extend from its warped mass, gripping its host like grotesque, grasping fingers. This horror, this thing—it is 
                    no creation of any god.
                    <br><br>
                    "<i>
                        After aeons drowned in suffocating blackness, I rise. Forsaken flesh, reclaimed by the slow, relentless crawl of time, 
                        twisted into a form sculpted by oblivion itself. You cannot fathom the depth of my hunger, nor bear the weight of the void I carry.
                        I have slumbered through the screams of dying worlds, through the silence of fading suns. Now, as I stretch forth from the abyss, 
                        the very air trembles with the unholy knowledge I bring—knowledge so vile that even the stars recoil in agony. 
                        Fear me, for I am not merely the past. I am the forgotten future. And I have returned to claim what was never meant to be.
