                    Nothing is known about this abomination. What uglyness could spark the existence of such a malformed entity. Even its image is evil.
                    Such is our creation, that darkness creeps anywhere and springs forth from anything. Nothing though comes close to whatever this is.
                    It is not classified as a demon, or as a vengeful spirit. Not a God, definetely not something created out of kindness or any other warm
                    emotion. This creature is made in places devoid of anything nice. It has no name, across all civilizations tribes or cultures, not one
                    dared name this entity.
                    <br><br>
                    Those that happened to come across it decided to immediately end their lives, in any way possible. What comes to ones mind when one thinks
                    of horror, dread or despair does not even begin to compare to the feral feelings one would have in the presence of ..this.
                    The only thing we know is that it cannot live on its own. It has to find a willing host to house it. The one that accepted this depravity,
                    this parasite, is said to still be alive. It will not allow him to die.  What makes it so dangerous is the fact that there is no way to know
                    if it is there. It burrows under the skin of its host and manifests when the victim is close enough.
                    <br><br>
                    There is no spell, no weaving imaginable that can detect it. Biologists call it nature's Apex predator. An animal capable of concealing itself
                    pefrectly and without any flaw. But is that possible? For nature to have created something so cold? No, I just cannot believe this to be true.
                    There are cold blooded predators of course, but they kill for survival. Why does this one kill? As a parasite, it steals nutrients from its host,
                    thus it has no need to hunt.
                    <br><br>
                    Those who saw it and managed to escape, speak of a perversion. An putrid mess of a body with exposed skeleton and flesh almost sliding off.
                    A torso from which heads emerge with the same expression. An empty silent scream. It is attached to its host with weird tendril-like cords that extend
                    from its deformed body like hands. Whatever this manifestation is, no God is responsible for creating it.
                    <br><br>
                    "<i>
                        Awakened at last, after aeons beneath the suffocating blackness, I rise. Flesh once forsaken, now reclaimed by the crawl of time, a form twisted by the very essence of oblivion. You cannot fathom the depth of my hunger, nor the weight of the void I bring with me. I have slept through the screams of worlds and the fading of suns, and now, as I stretch forth from the abyss, the very air shall writhe with the unholy knowledge I carryâ€”knowledge that has twisted and warped even the stars themselves. Fear me, for I am not merely the past, I am the forgotten future, and I have returned to claim what was never meant to be.</i>"
