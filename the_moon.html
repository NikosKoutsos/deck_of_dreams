                She came shortly after Him. Sure, the Sun could light every corner of the Earth during the day. But his time was limited. Once he would set,
                She would make her appearance. As if it were a child, sneaking from its shelter in the night. And where there was darkness before, there would
                be light. Not the imposing light of the Sun. A dimmer, more gentle light in silver hues. Her glow was not strong enough to disperse the shadows
                but it was enough to blanket everything in all the shades of beauty. <br><br>
                Thus, this hide and seek would be played by the two entities for centuries. A game of love and longing. They grew fond of each other and soon after,
                love sprung, like a flower blossoming on barren soil. Or perhaps it was fate that brought them together. A cruel fate that would not allow them to
                be together both in place and time. Once in every while, he'd take human form and roam the lands in the dead of night. He'd find a clear spot and just
                marver at her beauty. Once in every while, she would do the same.
                <br>
                They left notes in the same place, like breadcrumbs, guiding them to one another. On a rare occasion, mortals would stumble upon one of them.
                He would wait on a mountaintop, or at a lake. She would wait in the desert dunes or at a cliff. As cruel as fates can be though, they <i>do</i> meet.
                <br><br>
                Their Union happens every Twillight. This rare occasion where the two skies meet and form colors that resemble feelings. Images that resemble smells.
                Alas, this phenomenon is extremely rare. It happens on Earth every ten thouasand years. They had to find another way. Something else.
                In His frustration, Solac cried and reality trembled. Through will alone, He moved, albeit a few inches. He kept pulling with all his might.
                And then it happened. He could see her, close enough to grasp her. Solac manipulated all the cosmic forces to be close to his lover.
                <br><br>
                That is how the first Solar Eclipse appeared in the sky. So powerful were the forces to bring them close that they both started orbitting.
                One revolution was Hers, the other His. When she'd be on top, the phenomenon would be called Lunar Eclipse.
                <br>
                Such is the story of Luna, of the Moon. An entity so elegant and beautiful and alluring, that even Solac, the Sun himself could not resist.
                <br><br>
                <i>So much time has passed since last we met my love, yet I can still feel your touch on my skin. The taste of your lips.
                   The next Twillight will be in five thousand years. Oh what I'd give to see you earlier than that. 
                </i>
