                    A creature of countless eyes, five visible faces and six legs. In the Celestial Mythos, al-Rashid describes this entity
                    as <i>The deity that willed herself in existence.</i> By all accounts this universe had no use for her, for all things created serve
                    a purpose, divine or otherwise. By manipulating a singularity she managed to weave for herself a rather curious body.
                    <br><br>
                    The left face sees into the past, the right face into the future and the face between into the present. The main face sees all three
                    eventualities simultaneously.
                    <br><br>
                    Of her six legs, two weave the past, two the future and the last two are capable of stealing someone's fate. According to Hamal al-Rashid, her
                    nature is closer to that of a Dreamer than an ageless deity. Only dreamers are able to manipulate or create singularities to support their existence.
                    But in the Dreaming Bestiary, there is not a single report of a dreamer or God with the name Arachne. There are however exerpts about the weaver 
                    of fates. A Goddess without a distinct shape, capable of shapeshifting as she pleases. She is describes as having five head and six legs and although
                    there is no mention of her being a spider, the similiraties are too uncanny to be considered a coincidence.
                    <br><br>
                    So, if she were a dreamer, there is only one reason why there are no mentions of her in their texts. She must be one of the first dreamers to ever walk
                    the Universe. The Legendary creatures that first came bearing the seed of Life, a well from which they drew their power. In short, it means that the only
                    person capable of shedding some light about her past is another Dreamer from her time. <i>The Tempest</i> i think he is called.
                    <br><br>
                    By his account, the Celestial Mythos is wrong. Hamal al-Rashid believes that she came to be around six thousand years ago because that was when she was 
                    first seen. The Tempest believes that she has not reincarnated as most of the First Dreamers did. He claims that she has been alive since those ageless times.
                    That when her companions died, she simply left her corporeal body behind and woven herself to the fabric of reality, lying there, waiting.
                    <br><br>
                    But as time passed, she had become so attuned to the fabric, she couldn't separate herself from it. Thus, she created a singularity to exist as an 
                    individual again.
                    <br><br>
                    Perhaps she was waiting for The Tempest. By all accounts, he is the only other name from the First Dreamers to have reincarnated. Or perhaps, she saw his
                    return as an opportunity to use some residual energy to come back. Many questions surround Arachne but as observers all we can do is wait. I find that 
                    truth has a way of revealing itself in time.
