                    "<i>You again. Seems like despite my best efforts, I cannot escape you. How did you find me here? How is it possible that you can
                        penetrate even my most elaborate defenses? Begone foul spawn, begone I said. There is no place for a fiend such as yourself here. You,
                        are not welcome.
                        <br><br>
                        So longs it's been since last we met, yet it feels like it was only a moment ago. But that is the way with you is it not? A demon that feasts
                        on fear, on horror and dread. About anything and everything alike. So long I let you poison everything you touched with those hands. All that I loved,
                        you soiled with those dirty fingers. 
                        <br><br>
                        What was it you loved to say? All for me, for my protection. What need did I have for such an intense protection from everything? It matters little to me,
                        the reasoning behind your actions. The means you used was for your end. My dreams, my hopes, any kindness, all yours to glutton.
        
                        <br><br>
                        It makes no difference anymore. I tried to reason with you, I did my best to come to terms with you but you don't care. You are a monster! That
                        is the role you're so determined to play. So I must take my mantle and play mine. The man that stops the monsters.
                        <br><br>
                        So you followed me here. You will come to find that I am not the defenseless boy you used to know. Now I know who you are. You are not nameless
                        anymore. How could I not see it, when it is written all over your broken form. 
                        <br><br>
                        You are Anathema. That is the name you chose. That is the name that was
                        gifted to you, like some sort of sick cosmic joke. As if this name could be perceived as a gift by any creature with their heart in the right place.
                        Begone foul demon. Begone I said. You hold no power over me anymore. Go back to oblivion. Back to the hellish plains from which you escaped. Leave this place.</i>"
