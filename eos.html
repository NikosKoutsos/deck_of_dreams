                <p>
                    Many songs have been written about her. Present during the world's shift from dark to light, the Goddess of Dawn is said to guide the rise
                    of the sun across the horizon every morning. Throught the many legends woven to her name, one is rather intriguing. When she was came to be
                    in this cosmos, she was described as the rarest beauty to ever exists. She drew her first breath and the stars sang and danced above her.
                    <br><br>
                    Her distress began when she found her white lily. You see, she was a lesser deity, not worthy of immortality. The thought of being caged within
                    the confines of a flower's petals and the machinations of Time would drive her insane. In an act of desperation, she went on her knees and prayed
                    for a renewal. She screamed her demands in tears to the barren universe with the hope that some God would hear her plight and help her. And a God
                    did hear her. It was Melandri who approached her. After calming her down, he listened to her demands. She wanted to be reborn in this world, it 
                    did not matter as what, what was only of importance was that she would be free from the shackles of Time.
                    <br><br>
                    Melandri could not make any promises to her. He explained that he had the power to force reincarnation even on creatures of divinity, but there was
                    no certainty that the creature would exist outside of Khronos. She did not care, so long as there was a chance, she'd take it. And so, the Many Faced
                    God began his work and Eos began her transformation. A few seconds later her appearance would change drastically. The beauty of awe would dissappear
                    and in her stead a frail bug would appear. A pale, silver cicada with wings made of glass and a tail that resembled a sword. They both were surprised
                    to see the white lily wither and dissapear. She did it, she stood outside the barriers of Time.
                    <br><br>
                    Melandri was speechless. He asked if she was satisfied, but the tiny cicada had no way of speaking. Instead she approached the God and brushed her wings
                    on his cheek. Without any further ado, the God sent the cicada away to begin her new life. She would always be grateful to him.
                    <br><br>
                    The cicada returned to Earths system and realised that her tiny wings were behaving strangely. Her left wing was reflecting the moonlight while the
                    other reflected sunlight. She looked up, only to see a one of a kind phenomenon, a Solar Eclipse. She saw the Creator God cradling the Moon so 
                    warmly. She saw them both smiling, deep in love. So moved she was from this extravagant show of emotions from the both of them, that she decided to give
                    them a gift. She started shedding her tough exterior. The shedded skin was like a copy of her. A hollow body that had inherited the properties of its 
                    original body. She flew close to them and left a hair pin made from her body. The pin would reflect both moonlight and sunlight.
                    <br><br>
                    Luna was quick to recognise the young Goddess and cried tears of joy for the present Eos had given her. In her last life, she was revered as the most
                    beautiful creature in all creation. In this life, she decided to instead revere beauty in the form of strong emotions, beauty in the form of love, of 
                    longing, of hope and dreams.
                    <br><br>
                    "<i>For if there is one thing capable of defeating the cruel passage of Time, of denying its ruthless existence, it's Love.</i>"
