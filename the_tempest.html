                Everything about his existence was irregular. The moment he came to this world, the stars danced, in a formation that had never been observed
                before. To those who knew, the stars didn't dance, they followed the Golden rule. The boy that had just been born made the universe shift in perfect
                harmony. A Dreamer unlike any other. Little did the world know, the rules of the game had already changed when he drew his first breath.
                <br>
                Took his first title, at the age of five, when the Elders of the Shapeless World deemed the young boy a Singularity. His destiny was fixed, or at least
                that's how it seemed at the time. Some months later an abduction would take place. The little boy would vanish into thin air. He was taken by nameless demons
                to a place that was known as <i>Limbo</i>. A colorless realm where only sorrow and despair lived. The rulers of that realm knew the importance of the little boy.
                Alas, what they did not know was that he'd find the way to escape.
                For the next months the boy would roam aimlessly into the cold deep space. That's where they met. Before help would arrive, the Abyss herself did. The little 
                Dreamer had no defenses left, so the Abyss burrowed herself inside. Luckily, the Saints of Garona, found him shortly after.
                <br><br> 
                There the Saints performed a ritual known as <i>The Miracle of Veresith</i>
                with which they attempted to replace the abyss with light. The ritual was over, half of the thick black tar was successfully removed from the boy's soul.
                The other half had already made his soul her new home.
                <br><br>
                The saints sent the boy away with a convoy as for them his existence was now a taboo. After all, how could a pure substance as Light coexist with the gaping pit of the Abyss?
                The events of his life at the age of 6, would lead to the arrival of his True Name. The boy would bear the name of <i>Loveless</i>.
                <br><br>
                Years passed. The young man joined the Weaving University for Dreamers. His powers in visualizing and materializing dreams were unlike anything the council and the 
                Headmaster had seen. After successfully finishing a taxing 10 year program, the Dreamer now at the age of 20 was about to undergo the <i>Naming Ritual</i>. 
                A ritual in which a True Name chooses the Weaver. The Headmaster, knowing the young boy's history, was rather eager to find out what would happen.
                <br>
                Clouds started gathering. Thunders began to roar, rain fell like bricks. The worst thunderstorm the system had ever seen. And the boy in the Eye of the Storm.
                The sea below the cliffs started smashing the bedrock. The Usurping name was stripped. In it's place his True name would sit. His fate along wih the fate of that
                of the world's was sealed. His True name roared loud as a storming lion. <i>The Tempest</i>
