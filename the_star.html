                    Since ages lost in time, mankind raised their heads up high to gaze at the night sky. To marvel at its beauty. To wonder at its mysteries. Thus, the dim lights from the stars always piqued humanity's curiosity. <br><br>
                    But that was not always the case. During humankind's first steps the nightsky was empty. Imagine a pitch black blanket covering all you could see. In this unending darkness, entities living far from our planet took to action.
                    Three brothers decided to change the state of the Cosmos. They took their swords and flew across the deep darkness of the Universe. Grasping their weapons, they started poking holes to the Edge of Creation. <br><br> 
                    One after the other started riddling the darkness with holes. And through those holes, light escaped. The blanket of darnkness was no more. In its stead, a beautiful fabric was woven.<br><br>
                    Later, the three brothers were given their True Names. Regulos, Romulos and Remus. The first Stars. They lived their lives defending the Cosmos and when it was their time to leave their corporeal form behind, their Father, Uranos turned them into bright constellations.<br><br>
                    Depicted in this card is the Star of Romulos. The Star of Hope. The Star of Dreams. The Star of Love. The Star of the Future. The Star of the Past. The Star of the Present. The Star of the Cosmos.<br><br>

                    <i>"Would you look at that brothers of mine? Look up. All these little lights dancing quietly. One for each of them. May they keep their dreams safe from horror"<br><br>
                    Regulos.
